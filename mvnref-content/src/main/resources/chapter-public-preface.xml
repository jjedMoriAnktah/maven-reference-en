  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>Maven is a build tool, a project management tool, an abstract
  container for running build tasks. It is a tool that has shown itself
  indispensable for projects that graduate beyond the simple and need to start
  finding consistent ways to manage and build large collections of
  interdependent modules and libraries which make use of tens or hundreds of
  third-party components. It is a tool that has removed much of the burden of
  3rd party dependency management from the daily work schedule of millions of
  engineers, and it has enabled many organizations to evolve beyond the toil
  and struggle of build management into a new phase where the effort required
  to build and maintain software is no longer a limiting factor in software
  design.</para>

  <para>This work is the first attempt at a comprehensive title on Maven. It
  builds upon the combined experience and work of the authors of all previous
  Maven titles, and you should view it not as a finished work but as the first
  edition in a long line of updates to follow. While Maven has been around for
  a few years, the authors of this book believe that it has just begun to
  deliver on the audacious promises it makes. The authors, and company behind
  this book, <ulink url="http://www.sonatype.com">Sonatype</ulink>, believe
  that the publishing of this book marks the beginning of a new phase of
  innovation and development surrounding Maven and the software ecosystem that
  surrounds it.</para>

    <title>How to Use this Book</title>

    <para>Pick it up, read some of the text on the pages. Once you reach the
    end of a page, you'll want to either click on a link if you are looking at
    the <acronym>HTML</acronym> version, or, if you have the printed book,
    you'll lift up a corner of a page and turn it. If you are sitting next to
    a computer, you can type in some of the examples and try to follow along.
    Please don't throw a book this large at anyone in anger.</para>

    <para>This book introduces Maven by developing some real examples and
    walking you through the structure of those examples providing motivation
    and explanation along the way.</para>

    <title>Your Feedback</title>

    <para>We didn't write this book so we could send off a Word document to
    our publisher and go to a launch party to congratulate ourselves on a job
    well done. This book isn't "done"; in fact, this book will never be
    completely "done". The subject it covers is constantly changing and
    expanding, and we consider this work an ongoing conversation with the
    community. Publishing the book means that the real work has just begun,
    and you, as a reader, play a pivotal role to helping to maintain and
    improve this book. If you see something in this book that is wrong: a
    spelling mistake, some bad code, a blatant lie, then you should tell us,
    send us an email at: <ulink
    url="mailto:tobrien@sonatype.com">book@sonatype.com</ulink>.</para>

    <!--TODO: Change this to mavenbook@sonatype.com when it is available.-->

    <para>The ongoing relevance of this book depends upon your feedback. We
    want to know what works and what doesn't work. We want to know if there is
    any information you couldn't understand. We especially want to know if you
    think that the book is awful. Positive or negative comments are all
    welcome. Of course, we reserve the right to disagree, but all feedback
    will be rewarded with a gracious response.</para>
